Hello, my name is Matt Waltz! I go by **mateoconlechuga** as my online handle, hence the name of the site.
I enjoy embedded systems, hardware design, and cybersecurity - but you can usually find me in the mountains.
I am currently employed as a Research Engineer for Idaho Scientific in Boise Idaho designing cryptography cores and reverse engineering computer systems. 

In my free time I love to hike, rock climb, ski, and ice skate - as long as I am moving I am happy!
I'm generally pretty decent at injuring myself too for some reason.
Cookies are my favorite dessert - I've found [this recipe](https://www.landolakes.com/recipe/18134/five-star-chocolate-chip-cookies/ "this recipe") to have the best chocolate chip cookies (and mixing in some butterscotch chips makes it taste even better!).
Don't forget to take it out a minute or so early to get that delicious doughy and melty cookie taste.

Thanks for visting my site, I hope you have a nice day!

The site is statically generated with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/ "Hugo"), and hosted on an old HP G3 EliteDesk I have sitting in my apartment.
Hack it if you want, I enjoy meeting new people!
Don't forget to email me at *matthewwaltzis@gmail.com* to let me know how you did it, there's always something I can learn.
