## Overview

Anyone who lives in Boise (Boize that is) is well aware of the Boise River that curves through the city, and the nice paths alongside it.
However, the source of the Boise River is much more impressive.

This adventure took place about 2 hours outside the town for a solid 8 mile in and out trek.
Although this post just touches on the North Fork, the Middle Fork and South Fork, along with many other tributaries, makes for quite the trip!

## The Hike

The trail winds through a rocky canyon, an early start to the morning gives a great sunrise as it touches the tops of the peaks.

A light dusting of snow can be seen on the hill ahead.

Luckily for us, the hike only required some light jackets and sweatshirts.

This interesting stump looks like someone brought the iron out and was going to make some waffles. Tasty... if you're a beaver.

A steel cable is used to move to the other side of the trail.
If you don't hold on, feel free to take a nice swim in the river!

The trees had just begun to lose most of their leaves, giving off a vibrant shade of yellow.
Sadly there were few and far between red colors.

It's really incredible just how high the canyon is.
The afternoon brought some strong gusts of wind.

The trail itself was rather interesting, as a lot of it consisted of treading over uneven rocks.
It sure was an ankle workout.

The river followed the trail the entire way, perfect for pictures and refilling of water.

After the hike, we found ourself in Idaho City.
A local favorite there is Trudy's, which has some of the best pies I have ever had.
Delicious!

~ Onward!
