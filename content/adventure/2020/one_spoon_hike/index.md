## Overview

On a clear yet windy fall day in early September, we hiked up to find some old volcanos.
The views were incredible, and the drive to get there was also quite scenic and fun!

The Lava Butte Lakes were formed after a massive volcano erruption ripped out the mountainside, leaving room for water to collect in the crater and surrounding depressions.
The lakes lay just outside of McCall Idaho, and provide some spectacular views of the surrounding area and peaks in the distance.

## The Hike

A wildfire has actually ravaged a substantial portion of the landscape, expecially around the lakes themselves.
The trail was open and clear (Trailhead #149), and made the hike in quite pleasent.

The fall colors made the hike even more impressive.
We did think we saw a bear prowling in the woods, but it just turned out to be Ron wandering around.
Silly Ron.

About 2.1 miles into the trail we reached the main ridge.
Lava rocks dotted the surface.
The sky was clear, however the wind was strong.

Looking over the ridge showed the valley below.
The wilderness seemed to strech on infinitely.
It's rather surprising just how open it all is.

The side of the ridge is dotted with shubs, giving it a reddish color that stood out among the darker rock.
The trail down to the lakes took us right through the largest swaths of it.

A friendly doggo was discovered hiking along the trail too!

The view down onto the lakes provided the best picture of how they had formed.
The charred trees gave it an almost ominous appearance.
We hiked down to the lakes and had lunch around the far one - no swimming, it was much too cold!

This was the trail down to the lakes themselves.
The red color was simply incredible - there was nothing else quite like it.

Here's another picture of the red colors and views.

After the hike, we stopped in McCall at My Father's Place for some scrumpious burgers and huckleberry shakes.
It was a nice day spent with some great people.

~ Onward!
