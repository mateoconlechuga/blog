## Overview

On a snowy day in early October, we set out to conquer Mount Hyndman, one of the 12,000 foot peaks in Idaho.
One of our good friends led us down the wrong trail though, so we ended up at this old Pioneer Cabin instead.
It was definitely worth it though!

The snow was light and breezy, making the climb not nearly as bad as it could have been. On the way back down we had some sun, which made the trek quite beautiful.
The hike itself was around 8 miles with ~2,500 feet of elevation gain.
Some rather nice early winter photos were captured, along with some nice hot coffee at the Java in Ketchum Idaho, a popular place for skiing and adventure.

## The Hike

The hike in provided great scenery of snow-tipped trees and peaks, however some of the more distant peaks were obscured by the clouds.

The climb up to the cabin consisted of what seemed like endless switchbacks in the silent snow, but upon arriving it sat overlooking the entire valley below.

The inside of the cabin was in fantastic shape, and an array of mattresses were available for an overnight stay.
A cast iron stove brought a little heat to the room.

At 9,500 feet, the air begins to get a little thinner.
We actually met a few other crazy hikers that were brave enough to take on the snow suprisingly enough!

Because of the clouds only a portion of the valley floor was visible.
I certainly cannot complain though!

All of the plant life had long since died or gone dormant for the winter.

The hike winds along the North Fork of the Hyndman Creek, with trees enclosing the entire trail on both sides.
There are some nice stops for refilling filtered water.

This picture was taken after we had come back down from the cabin.
Surprisingly this little portion of the creek's snow had melted due to the warming weather and increased sun.
The rest of the afternoon provided even better hiking weather.

Parts of the hike entered expanses of open meadows. There are some planks that also span a small offshoot of the creek. It was a little slippery with the snow cover!

Afterwards, we spent the night at the Warm Springs Hostel located just outside the main town of Ketchum.
A quiet little place, with quite the comfortable beds!
We later stopped in town for some food at the Sawtooth Brewery, and devoured some delicious food!

~ Onward!
