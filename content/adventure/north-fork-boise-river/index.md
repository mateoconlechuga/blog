## Overview

Anyone who lives in Boise (Boize that is) is well aware of the Boise River that curves through the city, and the nice paths alongside it.
However, the source of the Boise River is much more impressive.

This adventure took place about 2 hours outside the town for a solid 8 mile in and out trek.
Although this post just touches on the North Fork, the Middle Fork and South Fork, along with many other tributaries, makes for quite the trip!

The trail winds through a rocky canyon, an early start to the morning gives a great sunrise as it touches the tops of the peaks.
A steel cable is used to move to the other side of the trail a few miles in.

After the hike, we found ourself in Idaho City.
A local favorite there is Trudy's, which has some of the best pies I have ever had!
