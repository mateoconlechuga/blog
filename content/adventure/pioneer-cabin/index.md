## Overview

On a snowy day in early October, we set out to conquer Mount Hyndman, one of the 12,000 foot peaks in Idaho.
One of our good friends led us down the wrong trail though, so we ended up at this old Pioneer Cabin instead.
It was definitely worth it though!

The snow was light and breezy, making the climb not nearly as bad as it could have been. On the way back down we had some sun, which made the trek quite beautiful.
The hike itself was around 8 miles with ~2,500 feet of elevation gain.
Some rather nice early winter photos were captured, along with some nice hot coffee at the Java in Ketchum Idaho, a popular place for skiing and adventure.

The hike provides great scenery of snow-tipped trees and peaks, however some of the more distant peaks were obscured by the clouds.
The hike winds along the North Fork of the Hyndman Creek, with trees enclosing the entire trail on both sides.
There are some nice stops for refilling filtered water.

Afterwards, we spent the night at the Warm Springs Hostel located just outside the main town of Ketchum.
A quiet little place, with quite the comfortable beds!
We later stopped in town for some food at the Sawtooth Brewery, and devoured some delicious food!
