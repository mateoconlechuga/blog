## Overview

On a clear yet windy fall day in early September, we hiked up to find some old volcanoes.
The views were incredible, and the drive to get there was also quite scenic and fun!
<!--more-->
The Lava Butte Lakes were formed after a massive volcano eruption ripped out the mountainside, leaving room for water to collect in the crater and surrounding depressions.
The lakes lay just outside of McCall Idaho, and provide some spectacular views of the surrounding area and peaks in the distance.

A wildfire has actually ravaged a substantial portion of the landscape, especially around the lakes themselves.
The trail was open and clear (Trailhead #149), and made the hike quite pleasant.
