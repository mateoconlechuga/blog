Hello, my name is Matt Waltz! I go by [**MateoConLechuga**](https://github.com/mateoconlechuga) online, hence the name of the site.
I enjoy embedded systems, hardware design, and cybersecurity - but you can usually find me in the mountains.
This is where I host the pictures I've taken of some of my adventures.
I am currently employed in Boise Idaho as a Research Engineer for Idaho Scientific designing cryptography cores and reverse engineering computer systems.  

In my free time I love to hike, rock climb, ski, and ice skate - as long as I am moving I am happy!
I'm generally pretty decent at injuring myself too for some reason.
Cookies are my favorite dessert - I've found [this recipe](https://www.landolakes.com/recipe/18134/five-star-chocolate-chip-cookies/ "this recipe") to have the best chocolate chip cookies (and mixing in some butterscotch chips makes it taste even better!).
Don't forget to take it out a minute or so early to get that delicious doughy and melty cookie taste.  

Thanks for visting my site, I hope you have a nice day!
