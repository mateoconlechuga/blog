Hello, my name is Matthew Waltz! My online handle is [**MateoConLechuga**](https://github.com/mateoconlechuga).
I enjoy embedded systems, hardware design, and cybersecurity - but you can usually find me in the mountains.
This is where I host the pictures I've taken of some of my adventures.
I am currently employed at Idaho Scientific as a Research Engineer designing secure systems and reverse engineering electronics.

In my free time I love to hike, rock climb, ski, and ice skate - as long as I am moving I am happy!
I'm fairly decent at injuring myself too for some reason.

Thanks for visting!
